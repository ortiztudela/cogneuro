# Cognitive Neuroscience Podcast Collection

Welcome to the repository for student-created podcasts in the Cognitive Neuroscience bachelor course of the University of Granada! These podcasts are created as part of an educational activity where students explore and discuss various topics in cognitive neuroscience. You can read more about it [here](https://ortiztudela.github.io/ortiztudela/teaching/ncc-2425_book/index.html).

This activity was originally conceived and guided by [Javier Ortiz-Tudela](https://ortiztudela.github.io/ortiztudela/) and [Carlos González-García](https://gonzalezgarcia.github.io/) in the Fall of 2023.

You can find a list of our expert contributors [here](CONTRIBUTORS.md).
